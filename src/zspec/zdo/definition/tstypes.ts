     *   - This bit indicates the state of nwkPreferredParent from the NIB of the local device.
     *     When supported, it extends Hub Connecivity, advertising the devices capacity to be the parent for an additional device.
     *     A value of 1 means that this device should be preferred. A value of 0 indicates that it should not be preferred.
     *     Devices that do not make this determination SHALL always report a value of 0.
     * 3 Battery Backup
     *   - This bit indicates that the router has battery backup and thus will not be affected by temporary losses in power.
     * 4 Enhanced Beacon Request Support
     *   - When this bit is set to 1, it indicates that the router supports responding to Enhanced beacon requests as defined by IEEE Std 802.15.4.
     *     A zero for this bit indicates the device has no support for responding to enhanced beacon requests.
     * 5 MAC Data Poll Keepalive Support
     *   - This indicates that the device has support for the MAC Data Poll Keepalive method for End Device timeouts.
     * 6 End Device Keepalive Support
     *   - This indicates that the device has support for the End Device Keepalive method for End Device timeouts.
     * 7 Power Negotiation Support
     *   - This indicates the device has support for Power Negotiation with end devices.
     * 8-15 Reserved These bits SHALL be set to 0.
