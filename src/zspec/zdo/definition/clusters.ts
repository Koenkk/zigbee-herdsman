/**
 * Defines for ZigBee device profile cluster IDs follow.
 * These include descriptions of the formats of the messages.
 *
 * Note that each message starts with a 1-byte transaction sequence number.
 * This sequence number is used to match a response command frame to the request frame that it is replying to.
 * The application shall maintain a 1-byte counter that is copied into this field and incremented by one for each command sent.
 * When a value of 0xff is reached, the next command shall re-start the counter with a value of 0x00.
 * 
 * The Device Profile describes devices in one of two configurations:
 * - Client: A client issues requests to the server via Device Profile messages.
 * - Server: A server issues responses to the client that initiated the Device Profile message.
 * 
 * Restricted Mode (`apsZdoRestrictedMode`) is a mode where a device will conditionally accept specific ZDO commands,
 * depending on the restricted criteria, source address, and encryption policy of the incoming command.
 * If a command is accepted, it is subject to normal command processing.
 * The acceptance criteria is explain further below:
 * 1. If the command is marked as “Yes” in the Restricted Command column, do the following:
 *   - a. If `apsZdoRestrictedMode` in the AIB is set to FALSE, the command is not restricted.
 *     - i. Go to Step 2.
 *   - b. If the sender is the Trust Center AND has APS encryption, the command is not restricted.
 *     - i. Go to Step 2.
 *   - c. Otherwise, the command SHALL NOT be processed. The receiver SHALL do the following:
 *     - i. If the command was broadcast, no error is generated.
 *       - No more processing is done.
 *     - ii. If the command was unicast, generate an error message. Create the corresponding ZDO Response frame with a status of NOT_AUTHORIZED.
 *       - No more processing is done.
 * 2. Continue processing the command normally.
