/* Send request policies:
'bulk':             Message must be sent together with other messages in the correct sequence.
                    No immediate delivery required.
'queue':            Request shall be sent 'as-is' as soon as possible.
                    Multiple identical requests shall be delivered multiple times.
                    Not strict ordering required.
'immediate':        Request shall be sent immediately and not be kept for later retries (e.g. response message).
'keep-payload':     Request shall be sent as soon as possible.
                    If immediate delivery fails, the exact same payload is only sent once, even if there were
                    multiple requests.
'keep-command':     Request shall be sent as soon as possible.
                    If immediate delivery fails, only the latest command for each command ID is kept for delivery.
'keep-cmd-undiv':   Request shall be sent as soon as possible.
                    If immediate delivery fails, only the latest undivided set of commands is sent for each unique
                    set of command IDs.
